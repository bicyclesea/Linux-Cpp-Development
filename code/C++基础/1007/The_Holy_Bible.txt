genesis 1

1 	in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth  
2	and the earth was without form  and void  and darkness  was  upon the face of the deep  and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters  
3 	and god said  let there be light  and there was light  
4	and god saw the light  that  it was  good  and god divided the light from the darkness  
5	and god called the light day  and the darkness he called night  and the evening and the morning were the first day  
6 	and god said  let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters  and let it divide the waters from the waters  
7	and god made the firmament  and divided the waters which  were  under the firmament from the waters which  were  above the firmament  and it was so  
8	and god called the firmament heaven  and the evening and the morning were the second day  
9 	and god said  let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place  and let the dry  land  appear  and it was so  
10	and god called the dry  land  earth  and the gathering together of the waters called he seas  and god saw that  it was  good  
11	and god said  let the earth bring forth grass  the herb yielding seed   and  the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind  whose seed  is  in itself  upon the earth  and it was so  
12	and the earth brought forth grass   and  herb yielding seed after his kind  and the tree yielding fruit  whose seed  was  in itself  after his kind  and god saw that  it was  good  
13	and the evening and the morning were the third day  
14 	and god said  let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night  and let them be for signs  and for seasons  and for days  and years  
15	and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth  and it was so  
16	and god made two great lights  the greater light to rule the day  and the lesser light to rule the night   he made  the stars also  
17	and god set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth  
18	and to rule over the day and over the night  and to divide the light from the darkness  and god saw that  it was  good  
19	and the evening and the morning were the fourth day  
20 	and god said  let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life  and fowl  that  may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven  
21	and god created great whales  and every living creature that moveth  which the waters brought forth abundantly  after their kind  and every winged fowl after his kind  and god saw that  it was  good  
22	and god blessed them  saying  be fruitful  and multiply  and fill the waters in the seas  and let fowl multiply in the earth  
23	and the evening and the morning were the fifth day  
24 	and god said  let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind  cattle  and creeping thing  and beast of the earth after his kind  and it was so  
25	and god made the beast of the earth after his kind  and cattle after their kind  and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind  and god saw that  it was  good  
26 	and god said  let us make man in our image  after our likeness  and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea  and over the fowl of the air  and over the cattle  and over all the earth  and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth  
27	so god created man in his  own  image  in the image of god created he him  male and female created he them  
28	and god blessed them  and god said unto them  be fruitful  and multiply  and replenish the earth  and subdue it  and have dominion over the fish of the sea  and over the fowl of the air  and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth  
29 	and god said  behold  i have given you every herb bearing seed  which  is  upon the face of all the earth  and every tree  in the which  is  the fruit of a tree yielding seed  to you it shall be for meat  
30	and to every beast of the earth  and to every fowl of the air  and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth  wherein  there is  life   i have given  every green herb for meat  and it was so  
31 	and god saw every thing that he had made  and  behold   it was  very good  and the evening and the morning were the sixth day  

genesis 2

1 	thus the heavens and the earth were finished  and all the host of them  
2	and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made  and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made  
3	and god blessed the seventh day  and sanctified it  because that in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made  
4 	these  are  the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created  in the day that the lord god made the earth and the heavens  
5	and every plant of the field before it was in the earth  and every herb of the field before it grew  for the lord god had not caused it to rain upon the earth  and  there was  not a man to till the ground  
6	but there went up a mist from the earth  and watered the whole face of the ground  
7	and the lord god formed man  of  the dust of the ground  and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life  and man became a living soul  
8 	and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden  and there he put the man whom he had formed  
9	and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight  and good for food  the tree of life also in the midst of the garden  and the tree of knowledge of good and evil  
10	and a river went out of eden to water the garden  and from thence it was parted  and became into four heads  
11	the name of the first  is  pison  that  is  it which compasseth the whole land of havilah  where  there is  gold  
12	and the gold of that land  is  good  there  is  bdellium and the onyx stone  
13	and the name of the second river  is  gihon  the same  is  it that compasseth the whole land of ethiopia  
14	and the name of the third river  is  hiddekel  that  is  it which goeth toward the east of assyria  and the fourth river  is  euphrates  
15	and the lord god took the man  and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it  
16 	and the lord god commanded the man  saying  of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat  
17	but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil  thou shalt not eat of it  for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die  
18 	and the lord god said   it is  not good that the man should be alone  i will make him an help meet for him  
19	and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field  and every fowl of the air  and brought  them  unto adam to see what he would call them  and whatsoever adam called every living creature  that  was  the name thereof  
20	and adam gave names to all cattle  and to the fowl of the air  and to every beast of the field  but for adam there was not found an help meet for him  
21 	and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam  and he slept  and he took one of his ribs  and closed up the flesh instead thereof  
22	and the rib  which the lord god had taken from man  made he a woman  and brought her unto the man  
23	and adam said  this  is  now bone of my bones  and flesh of my flesh  she shall be called woman  because she was taken out of man  
24	therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother  and shall cleave unto his wife  and they shall be one flesh  
25	and they were both naked  the man and his wife  and were not ashamed  
genesis 3
1 	now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the lord god had made  and he said unto the woman  yea  hath god said  ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden  
2	and the woman said unto the serpent  we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden  
3	but of the fruit of the tree which  is  in the midst of the garden  god hath said  ye shall not eat of it  neither shall ye touch it  lest ye die  
4	and the serpent said unto the woman  ye shall not surely die  
5	for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof  then your eyes shall be opened  and ye shall be as gods  knowing good and evil  
6 	and when the woman saw that the tree  was  good for food  and that it  was  pleasant to the eyes  and a tree to be desired to make  one  wise  she took of the fruit thereof  and did eat  and gave also unto her husband with her  and he did eat  
7	and the eyes of them both were opened  and they knew that they  were  naked  and they sewed fig leaves together  and made themselves aprons  
8	and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day  and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden  
9 	and the lord god called unto adam  and said unto him  where  art  thou  
10	and he said  i heard thy voice in the garden  and i was afraid  because i  was  naked  and i hid myself  
11 	and he said  who told thee that thou  wast  naked  hast thou eaten of the tree  whereof i commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat  
12	and the man said  the woman whom thou gavest  to be  with me  she gave me of the tree  and i did eat  
13	and the lord god said unto the woman  what  is  this  that  thou hast done  and the woman said  the serpent beguiled me  and i did eat  
14 	and the lord god said unto the serpent  because thou hast done this  thou  art  cursed above all cattle  and above every beast of the field  upon thy belly shalt thou go  and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life  
15	and i will put enmity between thee and the woman  and between thy seed and her seed  it shall bruise thy head  and thou shalt bruise his heel  
16 	unto the woman he said  i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception  in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children  and thy desire  shall be  to thy husband  and he shall rule over thee  
17 	and unto adam he said  because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife  and hast eaten of the tree  of which i commanded thee  saying  thou shalt not eat of it  cursed  is  the ground for thy sake  in sorrow shalt thou eat  of  it all the days of thy life  
18	thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee  and thou shalt eat the herb of the field  
19	in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread  till thou return unto the ground  for out of it wast thou taken  for dust thou  art   and unto dust shalt thou return  
20 	and adam called his wife s name eve  because she was the mother of all living  
21 	unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins  and clothed them  
22 	and the lord god said  behold  the man is become as one of us  to know good and evil  and now  lest he put forth his hand  and take also of the tree of life  and eat  and live for ever  
23	therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden  to till the ground from whence he was taken  
24	so he drove out the man  and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims  and a flaming sword which turned every way  to keep the way of the tree of life  
genesis 4
1 	and adam knew eve his wife  and she conceived  and bare cain  and said  i have gotten a man from the lord  
2	and she again bare his brother abel  and abel was a keeper of sheep  but cain was a tiller of the ground  
3 	and in process of time it came to pass  that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord  
4	and abel  he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof  and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering  
5	but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect  and cain was very wroth  and his countenance fell  
6 	and the lord said unto cain  why art thou wroth  and why is thy countenance fallen  
7	if thou doest well  shalt thou not be accepted  and if thou doest not well  sin lieth at the door  and unto thee  shall be  his desire  and thou shalt rule over him  
8 	and cain talked with abel his brother  and it came to pass  when they were in the field  that cain rose up against abel his brother  and slew him  
9 	and the lord said unto cain  where  is  abel thy brother  and he said  i know not   am  i my brother s keeper
